## 3. Summer Research Project Details

*   **Project Title:** Low-Cost Urban Spatial Data Extraction for Energy Modeling via Few-Shot Computer Vision.

*   **Problem Statement:** Urban Building Energy Models (UBEM), crucial for sustainable city planning, are severely hampered in developing regions by the lack of high-quality, affordable GIS data (e.g., building footprints, heights, road networks).

*   **Proposed Solution:** To develop a methodology that uses Computer Vision (CV) to automatically extract these necessary spatial features from publicly available satellite and street-view imagery.

*   **Core Scientific Hypothesis (The Innovation):** The project hypothesizes that a large, pre-trained foundational vision model can be adapted to a new, data-scarce city with high accuracy by fine-tuning it on a very small, manually-labeled local dataset (e.g., only 10-20 images). This "few-shot learning" approach aims to bypass the need for expensive, large-scale data annotation.

*   **Ultimate Goal:** To create a validated, low-cost, and scalable workflow that empowers cities in data-scarce regions to generate the essential data for effective urban energy modeling and sustainable policy-making.
